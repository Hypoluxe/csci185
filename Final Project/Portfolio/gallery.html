<h1>Digital works</h1>
<h2> Background: I made these in my photoshop class the first semester of Freshman year. It was my first time ever using 
    photoshop, but I really love all of these pictures. I don't know exactly where I came up with the idea of 
    these, but I clearly love the darker aesthetic.
